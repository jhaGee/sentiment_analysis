Positive
========
I have never seen a movie as good as God Father
Marvel cinematic universe will be always remembered as one of the best scifi movies ever
John Wick is a must watch movie
Don't watch friends all ten season because than there is nothing left in life to watch
The movie seven is one of the darkest movie ever produced

Negative
=========
Fast and Furious went down the drain after the fifth series
DDLJ is an overrated movie
The ending of the movie Robot 2 was pathetic
Welcome 2 was a complete waste of time and money
I was disappointed by the ending of Now You See Me

Failed
========
Breaking Bad was a spectacular series
God Father 2 was a good movie but not at par with God Father 1
People should understand that the movie PK was not degrading any religion
Zero movie was not worth the hype that it received
